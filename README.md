**Data Structure & Algorithm Practice**

- Big O (Worst case time complexity) for Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort is O(n^2)
- Big O for insertion sort is O(n) when array is almost already sorted

- Big O for merge sort is O(n log n) : 'log n' for dividing the initial array recursively & 'n'  
  for merging the individual elements in combined result array(loop through n elements)

- Big O for quick sort is also O (n log n) but in worst possible scenaio where every element in
  array was already sorted it will be O(n^2)
